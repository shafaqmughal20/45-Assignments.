//12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let friendsName:string[]= [ "rida" , "hiba", "urooj" ];
let message:string=" is microbiologist"

console.log( friendsName [0] + " "+ message)
console.log(friendsName [1] + " " + message)
console.log(friendsName [2] + " " + message)

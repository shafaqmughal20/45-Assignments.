//23.Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

//let car = 'subaru';

//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

//console.log(car == 'subaru')

//• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

//• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.


// making variables
let five = 5;
let ten = 10;

//test 1 
console.log("test 1 = five is equal to 5")
console.log(five == 5)
 
//test 2
console.log("test 2 = ten is equal to 10")
console.log(10 ==10)

//test 3 
console.log("test 3 = five is not equal to 10")
console.log(five != 10)

//test 4 
console.log("test 4 = ten is not equal to 5")
console.log(ten != 5)

//test 5 
console.log("test 5 = ten is greater then 5")
console.log(ten > 5)


//test 6
console.log("test 6 = ten is smaller then 5")
console.log(ten < 5)

//test7 
console.log("test 7 = ten is equal to 5")
console.log(ten == 5)

//test 8
console.log("test 8 = five is equal to 10")
console.log(five == 10)

//test 9
console.log("test 9 = five is greater then equals to 10")
console.log(five >= 10)

//test 10
console.log("test 10 = ten is not equals to 10 ")
console.log(ten != 10)
